This report presents an analysis and prediction of baseball team performance, focusing on the number of wins (TARGET_WINS) using the Moneyball dataset. The study employs various statistical models to explore the relationships between key performance variables such as batting, pitching, baserunning, and fielding statistics. 
Key findings from the regression models demonstrate significant coefficients, revealing important insights. The Baseline Model, which used original variables, shows that batting hits (TEAM_BATTING_H) positively influences the number of wins, while fielding errors (TEAM_FIELDING_E) and double plays (TEAM_FIELDING_DP) have a negative impact, reflecting the importance of reducing defensive mistakes. Walks (TEAM_BATTING_BB) and stolen bases (TEAM_BASERUN_SB) also contribute positively to team success, as expected, indicating that offensive opportunities like walks and successful base running are crucial for scoring more runs and securing wins.
In the Feature Selection Model, multicollinearity was addressed, with variables selected based on their contribution to the model. Interaction Terms Model explored how combining certain variables could reveal more nuanced relationships, such as the interaction between batting hits and doubles, which further emphasizes the effect of collective offensive performance on wins.
Ultimately, the Baseline Model was selected for its balance of simplicity, interpretability, and performance, with an adjusted R-squared of 0.31. This model's coefficients align well with intuition, where stronger offensive performance and fewer defensive errors predict more wins. The model was evaluated on new data, confirming its predictive power. 
This analysis provides a strong foundation for understanding team dynamics and improving decision-making in player management and game strategy.
